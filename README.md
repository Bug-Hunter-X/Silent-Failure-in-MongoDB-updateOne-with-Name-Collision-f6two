# MongoDB updateOne Silent Failure

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in MongoDB's `updateOne` operation where a name collision between the filter and update parameters can lead to a silent failure.  The operation appears to succeed, but no changes are made to the database.

## Bug Description
The issue occurs when the update operation tries to modify a field that's also used in the filter.  If MongoDB encounters this, it silently ignores the update instead of throwing an error.  This makes debugging difficult because there's no clear indication that the update failed.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have MongoDB and Node.js installed.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `node bug.js`. Observe that the operation appears to succeed (returns an acknowledgement), but no changes are applied to the document in the collection.
5. Run `node bugSolution.js` to see a solution.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully checking for potential field name collisions between the filter and update statements. Avoid using the same field name in both.  If necessary, restructure your update operation to work around these collisions.  See `bugSolution.js` for an example.
